# Flutter specific files

.metadata                   # Flutter tool metadata

# Build artifacts (generated by Flutter build process)

/ios/.symlinks/             # iOS build symlinks

# --- Sensitive and Private Information (CRITICAL FOR SECURITY) ---

# Android signing and local properties
android/local.properties    # Local SDK paths, NDK paths - specific to your machine
android/key.properties      # Private file often containing keystore passwords
*.jks                       # Java KeyStore files (for signing Android apps)
*.keystore                  # Generic keystore files

# API Keys and configuration files (If they contain sensitive data)
# IMPORTANT: If your `google-services.json` or `GoogleService-Info.plist`
# contains sensitive API keys that you *don't* want public, keep them ignored.
# For Firebase, these often contain public-facing project IDs, but some prefer
# to keep them private or inject them via CI/CD pipelines.
android/app/google-services.json     # Firebase Android config
ios/Runner/GoogleService-Info.plist  # Firebase iOS config

# Environment variable files (if you use packages like `flutter_dotenv`)
.env                        # Generic environment file (e.g., for `flutter_dotenv`)
# If you create any custom Dart files purely for secrets, add them here
lib/secrets.dart            # Example for a custom secrets file
lib/keys.dart               # Example for a custom keys file
